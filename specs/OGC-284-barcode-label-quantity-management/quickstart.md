# Quickstart: OGC-284 Full-Scope Delivery

> **Status (2026-05-19):** Superseded by [OGC-285](../OGC-285-barcode-label-presets/spec.md). The v2 preset model replaces the 5-fixed-type design; unshipped FRs from this spec are absorbed into OGC-285 milestones per the [Gap Closure Matrix](./spec.md#gap-closure-matrix). **No further edits to this directory** — historical reference only.

## Goal

Use the already-completed OGC-284 remediation baseline as the starting point for
full Jira/design delivery.

This quickstart now distinguishes between:

- **Completed baseline** already present on the current OGC-284 branches
- **Remaining implementation** needed to satisfy the clarified full-scope spec

This document is intended to help developers finish the missing workflow UX
without losing the verified remediation work that already exists.

---

## 1) Completed baseline already on branch

The following work is already present and should be treated as enabling
foundation, not as the remaining feature scope:

- Barcode configuration quantity/i18n hardening
- Sample/sample-item barcode persistence and upsert behavior
- Pathology quantity persistence wiring
- Label resilience and max-limit enforcement
- CI/review closure evidence for remediation PR work

Use the execution evidence sections later in this file as proof of what has
already been implemented and validated.

---

## 2) Prepare environment

```bash
# Sync develop first (for M1 foundation branch)
git fetch origin develop

# Create milestone branches per Constitution Principle IX (if not already present)
git checkout -b feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m1-config-i18n-hardening origin/develop
git checkout -b feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m2-persistence-upsert origin/develop
git checkout -b feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m3-label-resilience feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m2-persistence-upsert
git checkout -b feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m4-integration-ci-review feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m3-label-resilience

# Recommended: one worktree per milestone branch (paths are examples)
git worktree add "/workspace-worktrees/ogc-284-m1-config-i18n" "feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m1-config-i18n-hardening"
git worktree add "/workspace-worktrees/ogc-284-m2-persistence-upsert" "feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m2-persistence-upsert"
git worktree add "/workspace-worktrees/ogc-284-m3-label-resilience" "feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m3-label-resilience"
git worktree add "/workspace-worktrees/ogc-284-m4-integration-ci-review" "feat/284-barcode-label-quantity-management-m4-integration-ci-review"
```

Use local worktree paths that match your environment. If milestone branches are
already stacked and published, reuse the existing branches instead of recreating
from `origin/develop`.

---

## 3) Remaining implementation in milestone order

## Step A: Shared workflow foundation

1. Inventory all sample-creation workflows that support barcode printing.
2. Define the shared labels-section row model:
   - one order row,
   - one row per sample,
   - editable applicable label counts,
   - running total.
3. Define the shared post-save print dialog model:
   - accession-number-based launch,
   - per-label-type selection,
   - separate print jobs,
   - `Skip - Print Later`.
4. Expand contracts and service orchestration so save flows return enough data
   to drive post-save printing and later reprint entry.

## Step B: Primary workflow UX completion

1. Implement the pre-save labels section on the primary order-entry workflow
   called out by Jira/design.
2. Pre-populate counts from barcode configuration defaults.
3. Validate applicable label types and maximum counts in the workflow UI and
   backend.
4. Ensure saved quantities persist to the existing barcode metadata model.

## Step C: Post-save printing completion

1. Present a post-save print dialog after accession number assignment.
2. Allow per-label-type selection.
3. Send each selected label type as a separate print job.
4. Implement `Skip - Print Later`.
5. Provide print-later/reprint entry from the appropriate order/sample view.

## Step D: Rollout to all relevant workflows

1. Apply the shared labels-section and post-save print behavior to all other
   barcode-printing sample-creation workflows identified in Step A.
2. Reuse shared orchestration and avoid per-workflow divergence.
3. Confirm consistent behavior across generic sample, notebook, batch, and
   pathology-related flows as applicable.

### Workflow inventory (M5 T008)

Authoritative list of sample-creation workflows that support barcode printing
and must implement the OGC-284 labels UI and post-save print flow. M8 rollout
tasks (T037, T038, T040, T041) use this list as scope.

| Workflow / entry point                                          | Labels UI | Post-save print | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add Order (`/SamplePatientEntry`)                               | M6        | M7              | Primary; implement first.                                    |
| Generic Sample Order (`/rest/GenericSampleOrder`)               | M8        | M8              | Uses shared labels section/orchestration after primary flow. |
| Notebook Sample Order (`NotebookSampleOrder`)                   | M8        | M8              | Uses the same labels row semantics and print behavior.       |
| Batch Order Entry (`SampleBatchEntry`)                          | M8        | M8              | Reuse shared model; no workflow-specific divergence.         |
| Pathology Case View (`PathologyCaseView`)                       | M8        | M8              | Pathology family rollout via shared orchestration.           |
| Immunohistochemistry Case View (`ImmunohistochemistryCaseView`) | M8        | M8              | Pathology family rollout via shared orchestration.           |
| Cytology Case View (`CytologyCaseView`)                         | M8        | M8              | Pathology family rollout via shared orchestration.           |

### Print PDF endpoints (T012)

Documented print-PDF endpoint patterns used by post-save print and later
reprint:

- `GET /api/barcode/print/{orderId}/{labelType}`
- `GET /api/barcode/print/{orderId}/{labelType}/{sampleId}`

---

## 4) Verification checklist

- [ ] Completed baseline behavior remains intact
- [ ] All in-scope workflows expose the required labels UI
- [ ] Labels UI shows one order row, one row per sample, and running total
- [ ] Post-save dialog appears after accession assignment
- [ ] Each selected label type prints as a separate print job
- [ ] `Skip - Print Later` works and preserves reprint entry
- [ ] Barcode configuration GET/POST behavior remains stable
- [ ] Generic sample order label count persistence remains stable
- [ ] Other supported workflows persist applicable label counts correctly
- [ ] ORM validation test passes for barcode entities
- [ ] Liquibase/schema verification passes for OGC-284 changesets
- [ ] E2E coverage demonstrates full Jira/design workflow, not only remediation

---

## 5) Recommended test commands

```bash
# Backend targeted tests
mvn test -Dtest="BarcodeInfoServiceImplTest,BarcodeInformationServiceTest,BarcodeConfigurationRestControllerTest"

# Frontend unit tests (targeted)
cd frontend
npm test -- --watch=false
cd ..

# E2E workflow validation (run focused specs during development)
cd frontend
npm run cy:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/<impacted-file>.cy.js"
cd ..
```

> Note: In this cloud environment, local tooling availability may differ. Use CI
> as final source of truth for full job-level verification.

---

## 6) CI and review closure workflow

1. Push remediation commits.
2. Re-run failed PR checks (especially frontend QA workflow).
3. Capture pass/fail evidence per previously open review thread.
4. Resolve GitHub threads explicitly once addressed.
5. Confirm PR no longer shows merge conflicts.

---

## 7) Finalization

Before final review request:

- [ ] Code formatted and lint-clean for touched files
- [ ] Test evidence attached in PR comment
- [ ] Review threads resolved
- [ ] Merge conflicts resolved

    rendering when configured.
  - `BarcodeLabelMaker` resolves specimen type context once and passes it into
    block label construction.
- Slide/freezer optional field behavior:
  - `SlideLabel` now renders configured optional fields (stain type, block ID,
    case number) using explicit context values.
  - `FreezerLabel` now renders configured optional fields (patient ID, storage
    location, specimen type, collection date, expiry date) from constructor
    context.
- FR-013 enforcement:
  - `BarcodeLabelMaker` blocks over-max quantity requests unless explicit
    `override=true` is supplied.

### Test execution evidence

- Command:
  `mvn -Dtest=BlockLabelTest,SlideLabelTest,FreezerLabelTest,BarcodeLabelMakerTest test`

## M4 verification matrix (prep)

Use this matrix to execute M4 integration verification across M1-M3 scope and
capture evidence in one place.

### Backend combined verification (M1-M3)

Run:

```bash
mvn -Dtest=BarcodeConfigurationRestControllerTest,BarcodeInformationServiceTest,GenericSampleOrderServiceImplTest,BarcodeInfoServiceImplTest,PathologySampleServiceImplTest,HibernateMappingValidationTest,BarcodeSchemaValidationTest,BlockLabelTest,SlideLabelTest,FreezerLabelTest,BarcodeLabelMakerTest test
```

Record:

- command and timestamp
- overall result (tests run, failures, errors)
- failing class names (if any)
- follow-up rerun command IDs/status

### Frontend verification (impacted M1 surfaces)

Run:

```bash
cd frontend
CI=true npm test -- BarcodeConfiguration.test.js --watchAll=false
cd ..
```

Record:

- command and timestamp
- suite/test counts
- any warning/error output requiring follow-up

### Cypress verification (impacted workflows)

Run individually during M4 work:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run cy:spec "cypress/e2e/AdminE2E/barcode.cy.js"
npm run cy:spec "cypress/e2e/storageAssignment.cy.js"
npm run cy:spec "cypress/e2e/storageBoxCRUD.cy.js"
cd ..
```

If a listed spec is unavailable in your branch, run the closest affected admin
barcode/storage spec and note the substitution in evidence.

Record:

- command and timestamp per spec
- pass/fail per spec
- console review notes
- screenshot paths for failures

### CI evidence capture (M4 closure)

For each rerun tied to M4 closure, record:

- GitHub run ID
- workflow/job name
- final status
- link to run

Minimum CI closure target:

- backend `checkFormat-build-unitTest-and-run` green
- frontend `static-checks` green
- frontend `build-prod-frontend-image` green
- impacted Cypress shards/specs green or waived with rationale

### M4 gate decision log

- PR `#3039` run `22923992486` (frontend workflow): all required jobs green,
  including Cypress shards.
- PR `#3039` run `22923992487` (backend workflow): failed on
  `checkFormat-build-unitTest-and-run` due Spotless markdown formatting.
- Decision: proceed with M4 preparation work on the stacked M4 branch, then push
  the formatting/artifact-alignment remediation and use the next backend CI run
  as the implementation gate before executing full M4 verification.

- Cypress fail-fast command: `npm run cy:failfast`
  - Result: FAIL due pre-existing/unrelated admin suite failure:
    `cypress/e2e/AdminE2E/organizationManagement.cy.js` returned HTTP 400 in
    "Add organisation/site details"; fail-fast skipped remaining spec bodies.
  - OGC-284 added spec status during fail-fast run:
    `cypress/e2e/barcode-workflow.cy.js` executed in fail-fast mode as skipped
    after prior failure.
- Focused Cypress command (new OGC-284 spec):
  `npm run cy:spec "cypress/e2e/barcode-workflow.cy.js"`
  - Result: PASS (1 passing, 1 pending)
- Playwright command: `npm run pw:test -- --grep "OGC-284"`
  - Result: BLOCKED in auth setup because `TEST_USER` / `TEST_PASS` environment
    variables are not set.
